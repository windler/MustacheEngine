MustacheEngine
=====

This is a gameengine for Android. I am not an OpenGl expert - actually far, far away from it - an therefore the OpenGl part lacks of performance. The main-engine works quite well but the integrated particleengine is hardly to use with many particles.

This should not be a revolution for gameeninges. It is just designed to demonstrate how an architecture for gameengines could be designed and - in my opinion - this architectures works quite good. 

I had no time to create a real game with this engine. Actually, I planned to but had no time for it and I am also not really good in graphics and sounds. But there is a small example of how to use this engine in the sources. I would be pleased if you try it out!

This engine comes wit the following features:

* OpenGL
* InputManager
* ParticleEngine
* Finite State Machine
* GameScreens
	* Layers
	* Animations
	* Actors
		* Animations
* Sound Manager
* GameScreen Architecture
	* GameScreenManager
* ...

Feel free to try it out! If you find any german comments in the sources I am sorry for that. I checked them before I uploaded but there could be any ;)
